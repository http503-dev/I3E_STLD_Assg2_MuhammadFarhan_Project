## ReadMe
### Instructions
This ReadMe includes detailed instructions on how to use and run your application. It covers key controls, platform requirements, limitations, known bugs, references, credits, and puzzle solutions.
### Setting
You have lost control of your spaceship & crashed landed on an unknown planet. In a daze, you found your way out of your spaceship to the terrain of the unknown planet. You have to explore the unknown planet to look for ways to repair your spaceship and escape from the unknown planet.
### Key Controls
- W: Move forward
- A: Strafe left
- S: Move backwards
- D: Strafe right
- Space: Jump
- E: Interact
### Platforms and Hardware Requirements
The application should be able to run on most modern hardware and is geared to run on windows
### Known Limitations and Bugs
- Game objects that have been destroyed respawn when coming from another scene (e.g. boulders which you break to access the repair station respawn after coming back from the repair station)
- No animations and transitions when changing scenes or even at all
- When respawning without hitting a checkpoint, they spawn out of bounds

### Puzzle Solutions
#### Outside Area
- Collect 5 pieces of biofuel and 5 pieces of scrap in the outside area.
- Players must navigate carefully through poison-gas emitting plants to reach the lab
#### Inside the Lab
- The player sees the crystal in a room blocked by another boulder. To access it they search around and find the pickaxe to break the boulder and obtain the crystal
#### Return to Outside
- The player breaks the boulders blocking the path to the repair station. And find crystals that can electrocute the player. They have to maneuver carefully to access the repair station


#### Repair Station
- The player crafts the engine using the collected items (5 pieces of biofuel & scrap and power crystal). They return to the ship, install the engine and escape
